Guides in this section are for those readers who have experience in programming,
who desire to work with the library more closely, either by building other
libraries on top of it, or touching the core itself. Or if they want to port it
to another keyboard - these guides will hopefully give enough of a foundation to
do either.

The only assumption made, is that programming concepts are not unfamiliar, and
that the object-oriented terminology is familiar to the reader. A bit of C/C++
knowledge certainly helps in understanding the code, but most of the overviews
should be understandable for anyone with basic OOP experience.

Knowing the intricacies of embedded programming is not required. Even though
some of the design decisions were made because of the limited resources
available, these will be explained at the appropriate places.
