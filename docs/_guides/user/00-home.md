The guides in this category are aimed for the novice user, who may or may not
have any programming skills. They do not go into the deeper internals of the
library, but show how to achieve certain things with it. They do not explain the
magic behind the scenes, but show the reader the tricks.

It is recommended to read the guides in order, as they appear on the sidebar, as
they build upon each other.
