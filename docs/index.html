        <h1>Moved!</h1>

        <p>
            The Akela plugins have been lifted out into their own small
            repositories, and integrated into Keyboardio's
            <a href="https://github.com/keyboardio/Arduino-Boards/tree/master/libraries">Arduino-Boards</a>
            repository, where the rest of the plugins live, too. There is
            nothing to see here anymore.
