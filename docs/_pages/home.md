**A**nimated **K**eyboardio **E**xtension **L**ibrary for **A**wesomeness
=========================================================================

[Akela][akela] is a collection of small libraries to extend
the [Keyboardio Model 01 firmware][kbdiofw]. A heavy work in progress, that has
never been tried on real hardware yet. Consider it a proof of concept that may
go away at any point.

Please refer to the sidebar for the documentation of the available plugins!
