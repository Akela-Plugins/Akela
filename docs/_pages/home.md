**A**nimated **K**eyboard **E**xtension **L**ibrary for **A**rduino
===================================================================

Akela is a library to build keyboards with, primarily aimed at
the [Keyboardio Model 01][kbdio], but likely usable by any other keyboard built
with an Arduino at heart. It is not the easiest thing to use, but it is not
terribly hard, either. On these pages, we will touch the design decisions,
trade-offs and other things behind the library, and also learn how it is built
up from many small parts.
