This is a collection of small libraries to extend
the [Keyboardio Model 01 firmware][kbdiofw]. A heavy work in progress, that has
only recently been tried on real hardware. Most of the things do not work at all
yet, work is under way to fix them.

While lot may change, the approach seems solid, and the library will stick this
time. Don't rely on it just yet, though.
