[Akela][akela] is a collection of small libraries to extend
the [Keyboardio Model 01 firmware][kbdiofw]. A heavy work in progress, with a
lot of moving or untested parts. While it has been tried on real hardware, a lot
of things are either buggy, or do not work at all yet. But work is under way to
bring everything into a usable state.
