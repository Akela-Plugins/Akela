<strong>L</strong>ibrary for <strong>A</strong>rduino
</p>

Primarily aimed at the [Keyboardio Model 01][kbdio], but likely usable by any
other keyboard built with an Arduino at heart. This is very much a work in
progress, has not been tested on real hardware, and may go away at any point.
This is mostly a proof of concept at this stage.
